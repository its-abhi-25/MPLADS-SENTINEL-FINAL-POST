"""
docs/frontend_contract.md #12 (graph-data) + one additive, non-contract
endpoint for entity profiles (BLUEPRINT.md §8).

GET /api/graph-data reads graph_node/graph_edge (app/models/graph.py),
built offline per run by scripts/run_entities.py -- never a live join over
work/payment/risk_result. Node/edge shape matches the old engine's
contract (backend/app/core/engine.py get_graph_data) exactly: nodes
{id, type, label, count}, edges {source, target, type, label}; `weight` is
an additive edge field.

GET /api/entities/{entity_type}/{entity_id} is new, not in the frontend
contract (no page calls it -- same posture as Phase 9's
GET /api/geo/areas/{key}/works). Its response model (EntityMetricOut) makes
denominator/interval/peer_definition non-optional, so BLUEPRINT.md §8's
wording rule ("show the denominator, interval and peer definition beside
every entity metric") is enforced by FastAPI's response validation, not
just by convention in the query that built the row.
